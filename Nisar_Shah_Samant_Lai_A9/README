REQUIREMENTS:
1. Makefile should be copied to the same directory too to make sure it runs perfectly.
2. copy the perf.txt file in the root project directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING PROGRAM WITH MAKE FILE:
make lr TIME=1(OR 200) INPUT_PATH=<S3 Input Dir> OUTPUT_PATH=<S3 Output Dir>

For e.g:
make ls TIME=200 OUTPUT_PATH=s3://aEight/output INPUT_PATH=s3://mrclassvitek/data

where:
TIME is the N a natural number representing scheduled flight minutes.
INPUT_PATH is the s3 dir location of history files in aws.
OUTPUT_PATH is the dir location in aws s3 where all the output files will be for cloud run.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERF.TXT:
We are not using the same perf program as professor original code we have done some modifications. Hence use our perf.txt and uber-perf jar.

You only have to put your aws accesskey and secret key.
You can find "access_key" and "secret_key properties" under s3 details section in the perf.txt file. Please put it your details.

Please modify the "jar" property in the perf.txt to <current location from where you are running the make file><Path.Seperator>nisar_kovit_a7-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Please modify the "name" property. Output of the program will be stored in the file as <name>.csv

Please modifiy following properties under S3 details section:
check.bucket = <bucket path>
check.input = <input bucket path>
check.logs = <log bucket path>
delete.output = <output bucket path>
upload.jar = <jar path in s3>

Change aws emr cluster properties under section "# AWS EMR Cluster Configuration" as per your configuration.
The only required property to change is "log.uri" pointing to the log dir.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT:
When the make runs successfully the end result will be a browser window which opens with the generated report with the plot. if not check for an output.pdf file which will be generated.

Output is generated on the cloud in the output folder specified with the output Path specified in the Makefile.

The output is downloaded and merged in local directory.
